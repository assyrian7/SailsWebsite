			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="tblock">Hello my name is Paul. I am currently a college student
			at University of California Irvine. I am studying Computer Science and
			striving to be a Software Engineer. I started my journey at Stanford in June 2014, attending a summer coding camp for two weeks.
			From there I discovered my passion for Computer Science and have devoted the majority of my time and effort into expanding
			my knowledge of it. </p>

			<h2>Projects:</h2>
			<h3>Barcode Library System</h3>
			<p class="tblock">I created a library system for my high school's speech and debate team. There were two halves to this two month long project.
			I first created a program in Java to create barcodes for a list of book titles in a file. The second and the most time consuming
			part of this project was creating the website that had a directory of all the books and their codes. Since this was my first experience
			web development, I used PHP as the backend and an AWS server to host the website.
			<br>
			<h3>Fibonacci Clock App</h3>
			<p class="tblock">I created an Android app that tells time as a fibonacci clock would. A fibonacci clock uses the first five numbers of the fibonacci sequence to dictate the current time using colors. The purpose of this project was to create a fun little app to publish onto the app store.
			<br>
			<h3>Proximity Vibrator</h3>
			<p class="tblock">I created a device with an Arduino Uno board that measures distance with an ultrasonic sensor and then determines the frequency at which an attached vibration motor should vibrate. The closer it approaches an object the more frequent it will vibrate and slower the further it is from one. This device is targeted towards those who are blind. The difficulty in this project was translating Arduino code to AVRC code.
			<br>
			<h3>Food Database</h3>
			<p class="tblock">During my C++ data structures class in my second year of college, I was required to create a database of a chosen data type. Assigned as the main project for the class, the database required a hashtable for primary searching and binary tree for secondary searching and organization of data. The curveball for this project was a small detail entailing that both the hashtable and binarytree nodes be pointing to pointers of the database data so that there wouldn't be duplicate data.
